![](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cl1pqrsvk005409ml9e9fk7av/project/2484945)

> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

sort with only two deques!

### Implementation Specifics
uses quick sort with two pivots. (because a node can be split into three on two deques)
